# Database-system, NTHU 2021 Spring
VanillaDB is a collection of simple-to-read, fast, and extensible database system components aiming to lower the barrier of new-system prototyping and/or learning the database internals.

Most relational database systems today are too complicated for practitioners, especially newcomers, to leverage and build creative systems/components upon. One main problem is that these systems have been optimized for decades, thus the source code is highly sophisticated and hard to understand. VanillaDB rewrites some key components of a distributed relational database system with the following goals in mind:

Simplicity: clean code (written in Java), intuitive APIs, and well-documented internals even your grandma can understand;
Performance: simple, but not the simplest, algorithms that deliver reasonable performance;
Extensibility: modular architecture that eases the modification, enhancement/pruning, and development of new systems.
The source code of VanillaDB is released under the Apache 2.0 license. And we are happy to hear your feedback or feature requests at vanilladb@datalab.cs.nthu.edu.tw.
